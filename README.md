## Overview

pp is a simple Python utility designed to manage and organize files and code by creating restore points. This tool operates seamlessly on both Windows and Linux systems, providing users with the ability to back up files, create aliases for easy access, and maintain a structured history of their important files.
Features

    Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on both Windows and Linux operating systems.
    Create Restore Points: Allows users to save the current state of files or directories with unique tags for easy reference.
    Backup Functionality: Enables users to create backups of files or directories, safeguarding against data loss.
    Alias Installation: Offers a way to create command-line aliases for easy execution of the script.
    Comment Management: Users can add comments to restore points for better context and organization.
    Point Management: View, restore, or remove specific points using their associated tags.

## Installation

To use pp, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Usage

The script can be executed with various command-line arguments. Below are the available commands:

```bash

python pp.py --install         # Install an alias for the script (Windows/Linux)
python pp.py --version         # Show the script version
python pp.py --backup <path>   # Create a backup of the specified file or directory
python pp.py --point <path>     # Create a restore point for the specified file
python pp.py --comment <text> --tag <tag> # Add a comment to the restore point with the specified tag
python pp.py --print-point <optional_file_name>  # Print all restore points or those for a specific file
python pp.py --restore-point <tag>  # Restore the file associated with the specified tag
python pp.py --remove-point <tag>   # Remove the restore point associated with the specified tag
```
## Code Explanation
### Importing Libraries

The script starts by importing necessary libraries, including:

    os: For file and directory operations.
    sys: To access system-specific parameters and functions.
    platform: To determine the operating system.
    argparse: To parse command-line arguments.
    shutil: For high-level file operations like copying.
    json: To handle JSON data for storing restore points.
    random: To generate unique tags for restore points.
    datetime: To timestamp backup operations.

Core Functions

    check_os(): Returns the current operating system.

    Alias Functions:
        add_alias_to_registry(command, script_path): Adds a command-line alias for Windows.
        add_alias_to_bash(command, script_path): Adds a command-line alias for Linux.

    install_alias(): Determines the OS and installs the appropriate alias.

    Backup Functions:
        make_backup(point): Creates a backup of a specified file or directory, with timestamping for organization.

    Point Management Functions:
        make_point(file_path, comment=None): Creates a restore point for a specified file, optionally adding a comment.
        print_point(file_name): Prints all restore points or points for a specific file.
        edit_comment(new_comment, tag): Edits the comment associated with a specific restore point.
        remove_point(tag): Removes a restore point based on its tag.
        restore_point(tag): Restores a file from a restore point using its tag.

# Main Function

The main() function is the entry point of the script, handling command-line arguments and invoking the corresponding functionality based on user input.

# Example Workflow
## Creating a Restore Point:

```bash

python pp.py --point /path/to/your/file.txt --comment "Initial version"
```
## Creating a Backup:

```bash

python pp.py --backup /path/to/your/directory
```
## Restoring a Point:

```bash

python pp.py --restore-point 123456  # Replace with your tag
```
## Removing a Point:

```bash

    python pp.py --remove-point 123456  # Replace with your tag
```
# Conclusion

The pp utility is a powerful tool for managing files and directories with ease. By leveraging restore points, users can maintain control over their files, ensuring important work is never lost.
